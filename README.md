# iPhone-Chart
A nice, handy, brief list of iPhone specs.

I made this chart in notepad during my spare time, adding onto it every so often. It started as a small chart just for fun, to test my memory on all of the different iPhone models, and if I could recite the storage sizes, or the colors that were available. I then just started to look up some of the things I didn't know, and added them. It grew into a nice, big chart, and I don't know what else to add next. I thought it might be helpful to others, and so here you go.

Have fun!
